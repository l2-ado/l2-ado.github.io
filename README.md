# Course-site-template
Course site template using Jekyll, Bootstrap and reveal.js

This is my template for a course website, using Jekyll, Bootstrap and Reveal.js.

I use Jekyll for site generation, Bootstrap for layout and Reveal.js for creating slide presentations for the class. I left most fields generic so I (or anyone) can create new course sites in the future.

Since Jekyll is a static-site generator, it is ideal for sites that will mostly provide information rather than have multiple contributors and comments. Although commenting can be added with outside services like Disqus.
